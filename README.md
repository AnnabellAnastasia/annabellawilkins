Mission-driven Full Stack Software Developer with a passion for solving complex client problems, thoughtful UI design, collaborating and sharing/teaching with strong teams. 
I have exemplary interpersonal skills and experience communicating value that builds relationships with an extremely diverse ray of customers and clients. I am fully committed to use my skills and passion for programming in a company that puts the “customer” first, as I do.
Being a lifelong learner, I have obtained three bachelor’s degrees and furthered my education by completing certificates for the UNC Coding Bootcamp, UNC Java Programming Series, and currently studying to become an Oracle Certified Professional.
My education has provided me with a solid basis for self-discovery of new and creative solutions. Developing software has become more than just my hobby, it is therapeutic. I gladly spend hours at a time improving and creating technical projects to try new tools and ways of doing things.
